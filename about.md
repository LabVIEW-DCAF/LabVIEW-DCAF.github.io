The Distributed Control and Automation Framework (DCAF) is an application framework designed to help developers by simplifying and accelerating the development of reliable and robust embedded control and test applications in LabVIEW and LabVIEW Real-Time. These applications range from embedded control systems in industrial machines to the automation of distributed motors, valves, pumps and other devices in large test environments.

The [landing page in the NI community](ni.com/dcaf) contains links to the Getting Started Experience for DCAF, and the code is [hosted within Github](https://github.com/LabVIEW-DCAF).
